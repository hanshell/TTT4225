This folder contains a C programming example of filtering a source
file in wav format.

Mhe main program is "filtprog.c". Additional functions are in 
"common.c", header files are in "common.h" and config.h".

The program uses the library "libsndfile" for reading and writing wav-format
sound files. It can be downloaded from http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile

Filter coefficients for highpass, lowpass and bandpass filtering are read
from text files.

Compile and link the program using the supplied Makefile (i.e. type
"make" from the command line).

The syntax for running the executable program is
    filtprog <input file> <output file> <filter coefficient file>
e.g.
    filtpog original.wav lpfiltered.wav lpcoeff.txt 
will filter the sound file "original.wav" using the filter coefficients from
the text file "lpcoeff.txt" and write the result to "lpfiltered.wav".
